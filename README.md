# TwitterSentimentAnalysis

The purpose of this document is to explain the web scraping and sentiment analysis studies on Twitter that I have done throughout the course. It will explain the purpose and features of the tools used, their interfaces, what they will do, under what constraints they should work, and how they will react to external stimuli.

Specifically, this project focuses on gathering real-time or historical Twitter data using APIs, processing it to extract meaningful insights, and performing sentiment analysis to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The document will also detail the methods used for data preprocessing, sentiment classification algorithms or libraries (such as Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), TextBlob, or pre-trained machine learning models) ... Additionally, challenges faced during the project, such as handling rate limits or data cleaning complexities, will be discussed, along with the strategies adopted to overcome them.

By the end of this document, readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of how the project was implemented and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.
